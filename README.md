# Histone PTM Quantification Pipeline

This repository corresponds to the publication entitled, "A strategy to characterize the global histone PTM landscape within tissues of non-model organisms" (Mojica and KÃ¼ltz, in press). 

This repository includes two Rmd files in the "code" folder: 

### 1. "Ordering_DIA_Assay_Libraries.Rmd"

This file includes the code used to align the export of multiple Skyline files to one desired order for a DIA assay library. Instructions for using this file are included in the supplementary information of the corresponding publication.

### 2. "Tilapia_Tissue_Analysis.Rmd" 

This file includes the code used for characterizing and comparing the global histone PTM landscape in the gills, kidney, and testes of Mozambique tilapia. Notes are provided throughout the file so that modifications can be made for future use with other species and/or in other contexts.
